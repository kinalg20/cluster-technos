                    <div class="para"> In general, businesses outsource in two realms: front and back office.
                        Back office outsourcing refers to core business support operations such as accounting, payment
                        processing, IT services, human resources, regulatory compliance, etc.
                        And front office tasks are customer-related services such as tech support, sales, and marketing.
                        Majorly BPOs are known as call centres because a huge chunk of their revenue gets generated from
                        call centres only.

                        customers to contact you and clear the queries they have otherwise you lose them to one of your
                        competitors. Importantly, it also allows you to concentrate on the crucial tasks of your
                        business.
