                    <div class="para"> Healthcare has become one of the largest sectors, both in terms of revenue and employment.
                        Healthcare comprises hospitals, medical devices, clinical trials, outsourcing, telemedicine, medical tourism, health insurance and medical equipment. The future of the healthcare industry promises reliable, efficient, effective, approachable and affordable services. The growth of the industry has augmented owing to technological excellence. The healthcare sector across the globe is growing at a brisk pace and with Chornis being by side the health care domain has seen the real boost by availing the technological services. The IT market catering to healthcare is estimated to touch billions of dollars accounting for transparency in healthcare practices and financial incentives introduced by authorities.

                    <h3> Challenges and Opportunities </h3>
                    <div class="para"><strong>A step towards Competence: </strong>
                        The cost-effectiveness of any business depends on the number of errors and redundancies they commit while operating at a large scale. This fact is quite evident in the healthcare industry. Your organization can cut down on costs and efforts and expand its customer span by reducing the inefficiencies prevailing in the outline of the system persisting in your business.
                    </div>
                    <p class="para"><strong>Government Regulations and Incentives: </strong> The two decades have noticed the implementation of various changes in the healthcare industry globally, ranging from the consumer protection act to the introduction of the mental healthcare act 2017. Such type different changes have prompted businesses to deploy technological excellence that can encompass the entire clientele.</p>
                    <p class="para"><strong>Stemming Cost of Care: </strong>Increasing costs of prescribed drugs, consultation fees and a large populace of uninsured patients have potentially increased the expenses to be borne by healthcare and secondary service providers. Furthermore, the effect of the implementation of different rules and other regulations has adversely impacted the payer connectivity as well as the ability of healthcare providers to manage their revenues proficiently.</p>
                    <p class="para"><strong>Advancement of Patient Care: </strong> The drastic increase in technology dependency has empowered business owners and entrepreneurs in the healthcare industry to render quality patient care services for a major populace. With the use of technology, healthcare and secondary service providers can collect analytical data that can help them foster high-quality care and improvise general patient health but it is becoming difficult for major healthcare organisations.</p>
                    <p class="para"><strong>Booming Interest in Preventative and Ongoing Care:  </strong> Patients don't approach healthcare service providers only in medical emergencies, they are interested in amplifying their overall life quality. Businesses can yield benefits from this budding consumer niche by providing information and services related to early detection, fitness, prevention and overall wellness of the patients and for that healthcare organisations need to expand their technical front.</p>
                    <p class="para"><strong>Information and Integrated Health Services: </strong> The use of connected medical devices and AI-integrated software applications can provide a massive amount of data to the healthcare companies which they can use to generate information. However, most care providers, even top healthcare companies, lack advanced architecture and data management systems to manage data collected from multiple sources. The problem is the use of relational databases that cannot efficiently manage unstructured data collected from multiple sources, which means the value of the information they are getting is not absolute.</p>
                    <p class="para"><strong>Cybersecurity: </strong> Connected medical devices and a greater need to keep the records of patient information attract the attention of malicious hackers to healthcare providers.</p>
                    <p class="para"><strong>Outdated Technology: </strong> An outdated IT infrastructure hinders your efforts to overcome interoperability, big data, and data security challenges. Healthcare systems are already strained under an increasing load of bandwidth-intensive connected devices, according to HIT Infrastructure.  </p>
                    <p class="para"><strong>Big Data: </strong> Doctors expect interoperability to include patient health data from wearable devices and consumer apps. That’s a lot of data flowing into your system, adding to the already massive amount of information you’re currently dealing with.  </p>
                    <p class="para"><strong>IoMT –That is, the “Internet of Medical Things”: </strong> One of the widest and most promising frontiers of the digital world is the IoT (“Internet of Things”), the idea of bringing our everyday objects into the Internet from the house to the factory, from cars to entire cities. Among these “objects”, an increasingly important role is now played by healthcare devices. </p>
                    <p class="para"><strong>Healthcare tailored to the patient: </strong> One of the most interesting technology trends in the healthcare industry is undoubtedly personalization. It’s a trend that could radically change the world of health but also the well-being of each of us.</p>
                    <p class="para"><strong>Virtual reality: </strong> Virtual reality (VR) is changing the lives of patients and physicians alike. In the future, you might watch operations as if you wielded the scalpel or you could travel to Iceland or home while you are lying on a hospital bed. VR is being used to train future surgeons and for actual surgeons to practice operations. </p>
                    <p class="para"><strong>Augmented reality: </strong>Augmented reality differs from VR in two respects: users do not lose touch with reality and it puts information into eyesight as fast as possible. These distinctive features enable AR to become a driving force in the future of medicine; both on the healthcare providers’ and the receivers’ side.</p>
                    <p class="para"><strong>Healthcare trackers, wearables and sensors: </strong> As the future of medicine and healthcare is closely connected to the empowerment of patients as well as individuals taking care of their health through technologies, I cannot leave out health trackers, wearables and sensors from my selection. They are great devices to get to know more about ourselves and retake control over our own lives.</p>
